        <p>The short and intense career of Austrian figurative expressionist painter Egon Schiele was incredibly productive resulting in a treasure trove of masterful creations. Among his numerous oils, watercolors and drawings the subjects that stand out the most are self-portraits, portraits, nudes and landscapes. Schiele's style, life and unusually frequent use of his own body as a subject matter earned him a reputation of a bad boy of art and an egoist. Schiele's art and particularly his self-portraits are psychologically complex, emotionally and sexually direct, and intensely personal. Making a step further from his already daring work Schiele's nude self-portraits bring his art to a whole new level of honesty and intensity of emotions while using figural distortion as a tool to challenge conventional ideals of beauty.</p>
       <p>One of Shiele's most famous and best known self-portraits is the Self-Portrait with Physalis. This masterpiece, painted in 1912 when the artist was 22 years old showcases a perfectly balanced composition and shows him as simultaneously self-confident and fragile allowing us to connect with him on a deep personal level.</p>
